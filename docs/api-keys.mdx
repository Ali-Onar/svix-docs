# API keys

Manage your API keys to authenticate requests with Svix.
Svix authenticates your API requests using your account’s API keys. If you don’t include your key when making an API request, or use an incorrect or outdated one, Svix returns an error.

**API keys are per environment.** Every organization starts with a development environment with a corresponding API key. This key should only be used for development or internal testing and is not intended to be used in any production systems.

## Obtaining your API keys

Your API keys can be found on the "API Access" page of the Svix Dashboard.

## Keeping your keys safe

Your secret API key can be used to make any API call on behalf of your account. Treat your secret API key as you would any other password. Grant access only to those who need it. Ensure it is kept out of any version control system you may be using. Control access to your key using a password manager or secrets management service.

## Rotating keys

Svix support creating multiple API keys per environment. This gives you a lot of flexibility when rotating keys. For example, you can create a new key, replace all instances of the old key, and then expire the old key for a zero downtime key rotation.

When expiring keys, you can also define when you would like the key to expire. Either immediately, or at a later point in time.
