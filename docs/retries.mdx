title: Retry Schedule
---

Svix attempts to deliver each webhook message based on a retry schedule with exponential backoff.


## The schedule

Each message is attempted based on this schedule:

- Immediately
- 5 seconds
- 5 minutes
- 30 minutes
- 2 hours
- 5 hours
- 10 hours
- 10 hours (in addition to the previous)

If an endpoint is removed or disabled delivery attempts to the endpoint will be disabled as well.


## Failed delivery handling

After the conclusion of the above attempts the message will be marked as `Failed` for this endpoint, and you will get a webhook of type `message.attempt.exhausted` notifying you of this error.


## Manual retries

Your customers can also use the application portal to manually retry each message at any time, or automatically retry ("Recover") all failed messages starting from a given date.

Alternatively, you can use the respective APIs:
- [Resend webhook](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/resend_webhook_api_v1_app__app_id__msg__msg_id__endpoint__endpoint_id__resend__post) for retrying a single message.
- [Resend failed webhooks](https://api.svix.com/docs#operation/resend_failed_webhooks_api_v1_app__app_id__endpoint__endpoint_id__recover__post) for the failed messages recovery.
