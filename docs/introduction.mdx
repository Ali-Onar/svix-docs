Welcome to the Diahook documentation!

Diahook makes it easy to send webhooks from your service while ensuring robust deliverability and a great developer experience for your users. You can think of it as webhooks as a service.

## Webhooks are harder than they seem.

Webhooks require a lot more engineering time, resources and ongoing maintenance than you would first expect.

When building your own webhooks you have to deal with a lot of challenges, such as: unreliable user endpoints, which fail or hang more often than you think; monitoring and reliability of your webhook system; security implications which are unique to webhooks and much more.

This is where we come in. With Diahook you can start sending webhooks in under five minutes, and we take care of all of the above and more.
