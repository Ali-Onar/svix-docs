Diahook makes it easy to send webhooks from your service while ensuring robust deliverability and a great developer experience.

Other than the [consuming webhooks section](./receiving/verifying-payloads.mdx) which is meant for webhook consumers, these docs are meant for people using Diahook directly, rather than their users. As they mostly cover interacting with the webhook sender side of the API.
