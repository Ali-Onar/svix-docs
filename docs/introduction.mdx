Welcome to the Diahook onboarding documentation!

Diahook makes it easy to send webhooks from your service while ensuring robust deliverability and a great developer experience.

Other than the [consuming webhooks section](./receiving/verifying-payloads.mdx) which is meant for webhook consumers, these docs are meant for people using Diahook directly, rather than their users. As they mostly cover interacting with the webhook sender side of the API.

The docs already cover the main topics concerning using the service, however they are still a bit sparse in less common paths of the API. We are constantly working on making them better, so if you noticed an area that could be improved, please don't hesitate to reach out at contact@diahook.com.
