title: Overview

Diahook offers a REST API to interact with the service, and easy to use libraries to interact with the API. The libraries are only available for some programming languages at the moment, but we are contently adding new ones. If your favourite language is missing and you would like to see it added, please [email us](mailto:contact@diahook.com) to let us know.

Diahook also has an API browser and OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications at the [API specifications](https://api.diahook.com/docs) page which you can always refer to the exact schemas and endpoints available in our API. You can also use automatic API generators, such as [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to automatically generate client libraries for your favourite language until it is officially supported by us.

In order to authenticate with the API you will need to pass your `AuthToken` in the `Authorization` header, with the `Bearer` scheme. An example header would look like this: <q>`Authorization: Bearer YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN`</q>.
