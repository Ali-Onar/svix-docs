title: Overview

Diahook offers a REST API to interact with the service, and easy to use libraries to interact with the API.

Diahook also has an API browser and OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specifications at the [API specifications](https://api.diahook.com/docs) page which you can always refer to the exact schemas and endpoints available in our API. You can also use automatic API generators, such as [OpenAPI Generator](https://github.com/OpenAPITools/openapi-generator) to automatically generate client libraries for your favourite language until it is officially supported by us.
