This page has everything you need to start sending webhooks with Diahook.


### Main concepts

In Diahook you have three important entities you will be interacting with:

- `messages`: these are the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and a few other properties.
- `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to create one application for each of your users.
- `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that application will be sent to all of them.


## Getting started

Get your authentication token (`AuthToken`) from the [Diahook dashboard](https://dashboard.diahook.com).

## Sending messages

### Creating an application

Each of your users needs an associated application. The easiest way is to create a new application whenever a user signs up. In this section we will use the [create application API endpoint](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/application/create_application_api_v1_app__post) to create an application.

You would need the application's ID when sending messages. You can either save the ID returned when creating the application, or set your own unique id (e.g. your user's username or internal database id) in the optional `uid` field and use that intsead.

Code example:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
import { Diahook } from "diahook";

const dh = new Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN");
const app = await dh.application.create({name: "Application name"});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
from diahook import Diahook, ApplicationIn

dh = Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN")
app = dh.application.create(ApplicationIn(name="Application name"))
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.diahook.com/api/v1/app/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"name": "Application name"}'
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


### Send a message

We will now send a new message using the [create message API endpoint](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/message/create_message_api_v1_app__app_id__msg__post). It accepts an `app_id`, which is the application's ID (or custom `uid`) from the previous section. In addition, it accepts the following fields (as part the json body):

- `eventType`: an identifier denoting the type of the event. E.g. `invoice.paid`.
- `eventId`: an optional unique ID for the event. This is useful if you want to map each message to unique events on your system. This is also used as an idempotency key.
- `data`: a JSON dictionary that can hold anything. Its content will be sent as the webhook content.


For example:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const dh = new Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN");
await dh.message.create("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0", {
    "eventType": "invoice.paid",
    "eventId": "evt_Wqb1k73rXprtTm7Qdlr38G",
    "data": {
        "id": "invoice_WF7WtCLFFtd8ubcTgboSFNql",
        "status": "paid",
        "attempt": 2
    }
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
dh = Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN")
dh.message.create(
    "app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0",
    MessageIn(
        event_type: "invoice.paid",
        event_id: "evt_Wqb1k73rXprtTm7Qdlr38G",
        data: {
            "id": "invoice_WF7WtCLFFtd8ubcTgboSFNql",
            "status": "paid",
            "attempt": 2
        }
    )
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.diahook.com/api/v1/app/app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0/msg/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"eventType": "invoice.paid", "eventId": "evt_Wqb1k73rXprtTm7Qdlr38G", "data": {"id": "invoice_WF7WtCLFFtd8ubcTgboSFNql", "status": "paid", "attempt": 2}}'
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


#### Idempotentcy

As mentioned above, the `eventId` is also used as an idempotency key. This means that if you send the same request (with the same `eventId`) more than once, only one message will be created. The rest of the attempts will be ignored.

This means that you can safely retry sending messages on errors (such as network errors) without worrying about duplicate messages being sent.


## Add webhook endpoints

In the example above we showed how to send messages, though these messages were not sent to any specific URLs. In order for them to be sent, we need to add endpoints. This is what this section is about.

### Using the management UI

Diahook offers a pre-build management UI. With [one API call](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/authentication/get_dashboard_access_api_v1_auth_dashboard_access__app_id___post), you can give your users access to this UI and they can then add their own endpoints themselves.

More on that in the [management UI docs](management-ui).

### Using the API

In addition to the management UI, you can also use our API to add endpoints to your applications. To do so, you will use the [create endpoint API](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/endpoint/create_endpoint_api_v1_app__app_id__endpoint__post).

For example:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const dh = new Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN");
await dh.endpoint.create("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0", {
    "url": "https://api.example.com/svix-webhooks/",
    "version": 1,
    "description": "My main endpoint",
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
dh = Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN")
dh.endpoint.create(
    "app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0",
    EndpointIn(
        url="https://api.example.com/svix-webhooks/",
        version=1,
        description="My main endpoint",
    )
)
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.diahook.com/api/v1/app/app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0/endpoint/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"url": "https://api.example.com/svix-webhooks/", "version": 1, "description": "My main endpoint"}'
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>

The version number is an integer signifying the current version of the API. You can set it to `1` if you haven't started versioning your API yet.

## Closing words

That's it! There are only three API calls you should really care about. Creating applications (i.e users), sending messages, and giving your users access to the admin UI. All of them are covered here.
