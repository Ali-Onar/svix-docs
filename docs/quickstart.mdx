This is a quick document to get you started and covers the main interacting points with the Diahook API. This document is constantly improving, but it already covers everything you need to get started with Diahook.

### Structure

In Diahook you have three important models/routes you will be interacting with:

- `messages`: these are essentially the webhooks being sent. They can have contents and a few other properties.
- `application`: this is where `messages` are sent to. Usually you want to create one application for each of your users. You will need the application ID for sending messages.
- `endpoint`: endpoints are the URLs messages will be sent to. Each application can have multiple `endpoints` and each message sent to that application will be sent to all of them.


## Getting started

You should get your `AuthToken` from us when first joining. If you haven't already, please reach out again.

### Creating an application

Each of your users needs an associated application. The easiest way is to create a new application whenever a user signs up. Use the [create application API endpoint](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/application/create_application_api_v1_app__post) to create an application, and save the returned application ID in the database next to your user.

Saving an additional identifier in your database can be annoying, so you can alternatively pass your own unique identifier (`uid`) when creating the application, and use that anywhere that accepts an application ID.

Code example:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const dh = new Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN");
const app = await dh.application.create({name: "Application name"});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
# Will be added soon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.diahook.com/api/v1/app/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization: Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"name": "Application name"}'
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


### Sending messages

To send a new message use the [create message API endpoint](https://api.diahook.com/docs#/message/create_message_api_v1_app__app_id__msg__post). It accepts an `app_id`, which is the application's ID. In addition, it accepts the following fields (as part the json body):

- `eventType`: an identifier denoting the type of the event. E.g. `invoice.paid`.
- `eventId`: an optional unique ID for the event. This is useful if you want to map each message to unique events on your system. This is also used as an idempotency key.
- `data`: a JSON dictionary that can hold anything. Its content will be sent as the webhook content.


For example:

<CodeTabs>
<TabItem value="js">

```js
const dh = new Diahook("AUTH_TOKEN");
await dh.message.create("app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0", {
    "eventType": "invoice.paid",
    "eventId": "evt_Wqb1k73rXprtTm7Qdlr38G",
    "data": {
        "id": "invoice_WF7WtCLFFtd8ubcTgboSFNql",
        "status": "paid",
        "attempt": 2
    }
});
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="py">

```python
# Will be added soon
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="curl">

```shell
curl -X POST "https://api.diahook.com/api/v1/app/app_Xzx8bQeOB1D1XEYmAJaRGoj0/msg/" \
    -H  "Accept: application/json" \
    -H  "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -H  "Authorization:  Bearer AUTH_TOKEN" \
    -d '{"eventType": "invoice.paid", "eventId": "evt_Wqb1k73rXprtTm7Qdlr38G", "data": {"id": "invoice_WF7WtCLFFtd8ubcTgboSFNql", "status": "paid", "attempt": 2}}'
```

</TabItem>
</CodeTabs>


#### Idempotentcy

As mentioned above, the `eventId` is also used as an idempotency key. This means that if you send the same request (with the same `eventId`) more than once, only one message will be created. The rest of the attempts will be ignored.

This means that you can safely retry sending messages on errors (such as network errors) without worrying about duplicate messages being sent.


### Management UI + adding endpoints

You have two options for adding endpoints for your users (where endpoints will be sent). The first is to do it using the endpoints API, and the second is to just give them access to the admin UI.

For more information please refer to the [management UI docs](management-ui).


## Closing words

That's it! There are only three API calls you should really care about. Creating applications (i.e users), sending messages, and giving your users access to the admin UI.
