title: Receiving Webhooks with Bridge

[Svix Bridge] is useful in cases where you want to consume webhooks and write the payloads to a message queue.

Since Bridge can act as an HTTP server, you can configure it as an Endpoint in Svix.
Bridge can even verify webhooks when configured with an `endpoint_secret`.

For example, receiving webhooks from Svix, lightly reshaping the payload, then publishing to RabbitMQ might be
configured like this:

```yaml
receivers:
  - name: 'events-from-acme'
    input:
      type: 'svix-webhook'
      path_id: 'acme'
      endpoint_secret: '${ENDPOINT_SECRET}'

    transformation: |
      function handler(input) {
        let event_type = input.eventType;
        delete input.eventType;
        // The `payload` field is what will be published to the queue.
        return { payload: { event_type, ...input } };
      }

    output:
      type: 'rabbitmq'
      uri: '${RABBITMQ_URI}'
      exchange: ''
      routing_key: 'acme'
```

The `path_id` defined here represents the trailing path segment for the route this receiver will match.
The route for this example would be `/webhook/acme` and sending a `POST` request here with a valid JSON body will result
in a new message published to the `acme` queue.

This is to say, if you're running Bridge at `https://my-bridge.example.com`, the full URL you'd register as a Svix
Endpoint would be `https://my-bridge.example.com/webhook/acme`.
See [Adding Endpoints](../using-app-portal/adding-endpoints.mdx) for more on how to do this in the App Portal.
